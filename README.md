# IPL-data-analysis                        
This project consists of data analysis and data visualization of all IPL seasons from 2008 to 2019 and answering the most asked questions about the IPL.            
I have used the following Python Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn and matplotlib.   

THIS PROJECT MAINLY HAS 4 PARTS:                   
PART 1: DATA PREPARATION AND CLEANING.                  
PART 2: EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS AND CLEANING.      
PART 3: ANSWERING THE MOST ASKED QUESTIONS ON GOOGLE ABOUT THE IPL.   

ANSWERS TO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS:                          
WHICH VENUE HELD THE MOST NUMBER OF MATCHES? (PLEASE OPEN IMAGE IN NEW TAB IF YOU'RE USING DARK MODE)
